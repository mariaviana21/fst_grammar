# FST grammar for Galician
A finite-state transducer (FST) is a type of formal grammar that is used to model the relationship between two sequences of symbols. FST grammars are used in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, speech recognition, and computational linguistics. 

FST grammars can be useful in terms of:
- Efficiency: they are designed to be computationally efficient. They can be used to process large amounts of text or speech data quickly and accurately.
- Flexibility: FST grammars are flexible and can be used to model a wide range of language phenomena. They can be used to model phonetic, morphological, and syntactic structures in natural languages.
- Integration: FST grammars can be integrated with other language processing tools, such as part-of-speech taggers and parsers. This allows for more complex language processing tasks to be performed.
- Machine Translation: FST grammars are commonly used in machine translation systems. They can be used to model the relationships between words and phrases in different languages, which can help to improve the accuracy of translation.
